 I am J. R. Damon

 I was born in 1993, and from a young age, I have always felt a deep connection to the earth and the spiritual dimension. I have a Nostalgic for Paleolithic. I'm a Taurus and a shapeshifter, I have a strong connection to the earth and the cycles of the natural world. Dogs have always held a special place in my heart, and I have always found comfort in their companionship.

In addition to my love of nature, I have always had a fascination with technology. I am particularly interested in virtual reality, EEG technology, and 3D printing. My work in the field of IT allows me to explore these interests in a professional setting, and I am constantly amazed by the advancements in technology.

I am also passionate about cannabis and magic mushrooms, finding inspiration and creativity in their use. I am a true cyberpunk, living in a future where technology and nature collide.

I am deeply connected to my ancestry, and I take time to explore my genealogy and learn more about where I come from.

Overall, I am a unique individual with a diverse range of interests and passions.
